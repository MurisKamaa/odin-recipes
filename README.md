# odin-recipes

The odin recipes project uses basic HTML to create 3 recipes
All set-up of files was done in the command line
I hope to be able to use links, images in html
The recipes are all obtained from the internet and they include:
Nyama Choma
Ugali
African Tea

After learing basic CSS, the recipes website was updated.
Classes were created in the index.html file
An image was also added in the home page
to be able to style the list of recipes, a class was introduced

The recipes files were also given classes in the description, the ingridients and the steps
the classes were then styled

A button was created in the recipes to allow the user to go back to the homepage
All changes were commited in git

Farther chnages will continue to be made as I progree in the odin project class
